<p>first paragraph. Human life is truly a very precious gift. Each moment of human life carries
 us an opportunity, to act to develop and express our virtues. Every moment 
 unlocks the path to us to receive blessings. This is the truth that life gives 
 us both positive and negative situations. What is really important is how we react.</p>

<p>Second paragraph.Life is the gift of God in the form of trust that we will make it meaningful in 
whatever we can. We are all unique individuals. No one is born like you and no 
one will ever be, so cherish your individuality. Many times, I come across people accusing God of things that they donâ€™t have. They always cursing their lives. But, do they realize that this life itself is precious? If we make it worth living and work hard towards positivity.</p>
